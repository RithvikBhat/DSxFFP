# [Deliberate Studios x Filter Free Photography](https://rithvikbhat.github.io/DSxFFP/)

# Introduction:
A collaboration website that allows visitors to view music and media. Visitors can browse through a large collection of music, photos and videos. A few tools have been added such as to allow users to make edits to their own photos and download them, a music player that can also play in the background while the user is doing some other work to improve his/her productivity.

# Abstract:
The project was built using HTML 5, CSS 3, BOOTSTRAP 5 and JavaScript. A contact form that connects to our email address has also been added using an API called Formsubmit. This reduces the process of managing emails 30% more efficient compared to traditional methods. The music player was built from scratch and plays high quality music which have been composed by our very own teammate. We also have added a photo gallery that showcases a collection of original photos taken by another teammate of ours. Overall it has been a great experience learning new things while developing this project as a team.
